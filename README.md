# python-api-challenge

For this projects I created a random list of cities to get a sample of all latitudes and longitudes, used an API call to pull weather data for each city, looked for trends in the relationships between weather and latitude and finally created a heatmap weighted by humidity with markers that hold hotel names for cities with ideal weather.
